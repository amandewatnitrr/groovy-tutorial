## Exception Handling in groovy

- In groovy, similar to Java we can do exception handling using following method `try-catch-catch-..-finally`

### `try-catch-catch-..-fianlly`

- We can have multiple catch blocks with exception handling in Groovy.
- Let's learn `try-catch` with it's generalised syntax and than an example:

```groovy
try
    {
        //Statements
    }
catch(Exception exp)
    {

    }
catch(Exception exp)
    {
        //Statements
    }
finally
    {
        //Statements
    }
```

## String in Groovy

- First of all let's start with how we can take string input from user in groovy,

```groovy
import java.util.*;

class main{
static void function03()
        {
            Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
            System.out.println("What is your name, age and Salary??");
            String str = sc.nextLine(); // for String Inpput from user
            int integer = sc.nextInt(); // for Integer Input from User
            double decimal = sc.nextDouble(); // for double Input from user
            System.out.println("Username is ${str}. Age is ${integer} and salary is ${decimal}.");
        }
    static void main(String[] args)
        {
            function03();        
        }
}
```

- We can also define variablles by initialization as well.
- But in groovy we can't print string within single quotes using `${variable_name}` method, this property is known as interpolation.

```groovy
import java.util.*;

class main{
    static void main(String[] args)
        {
            def name = "Name";
            System.out.println("My name is ${name}");
        }
}
```

- We also have '''content''' and """contnet""" i.e. triple single quoted and triple double quoted strings as well.
- Triple double and single quote strings are mainly used for multiple line string storage.

```groovy
import java.util.*;

class main{
    static void main(String[] args)
        {
            //function03();        
            def name = """My name is Aman Kumar Dewangan.""";
            System.out.println("My name is ${name}");
            System.out.println("Length: " + name.length() ); // .length() returns the length of the string.
            System.out.println("name[0]: "+ name[0] + " name[-1]: "+ name[-1]); // We can acess string address from back as well using negative index values.
            System.out.println("Position of 1 in string is: " + name.indexOf('n')); // returns the index of first matching letter in the string
            println(start..end); // prints the substring of the given string in specified range.
            println(name[index1,index2,indx3]); // prints the values in the string at tht specific position/index.
            println(name.substring(start_index,end_index)); // // .substring(_,_)extracts the substring from the speciffied starting index upto ending index
            println(name.subSequence(start_index,end_index)); // .subsequence(_,_)extracts the substring from the speciffied starting index upto ending index
            def list = name.split(" "); // Splits the string into a list with the given character as sepraator.
            println(list);

            /*
                We can also perform certain functions on strings as show below:
            */

            println(name -("Kumar")); // Removes the mentioned word from the string.
            println(name.replace("Kumar", "K")); // Replaces the mentioned word from the string with the specifed one.
            println name.toLowerCase(); // converts the complete string to lower case.
            println name.toUpperCase(); // converts the complete string to upper case.
            println name.toList(); // converts the complete string to list of characters.
            println name.equals(string_name); // compares both the strings and returns true or false. This is case-sensitive.
            println name.equalsIgnoreCase(string_name); // compares both the strings and returns true or false. This is not case-sensitive.

            // There are other methods as well to define a string.

            def s1 = /a My name is Aman Dewangan $name /
            def s2 = $/a My name is Aman Dewangan $name /
        }
}
```

- Points to remember:
  - Except Single and Double Quote initialization, all string declaration methods support multiple lines.
  - Interpolation is not supported for single quoted and triple quoted declaration or initialization of string.
